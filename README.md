# Synesthesia

## What is Synesthesia?
Auditoryâ€“visual synaesthesia is an unusual form of cross-modal integration in which sounds evoke involuntary visual experiences. 
For Duke Ellington, a D note looked like dark blue burlap while a G was light blue satin. When Pharrell Williams listened to Earth, Wind & Fire as a kid, he saw burgundy or baby blue. For Kanye West, pianos are blue, snares are white, and basslines are dark brown and purple. Orange is a big one for Frank Ocean.

The idea behing this project is combine all main musical notes and let user associate it with ar art or a color.
